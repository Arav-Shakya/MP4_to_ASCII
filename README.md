Here's how you can use this convertor:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install All the dependencies inside code
3. in the same folder keep a input.mp4 file ( I have changed to mov if you want you can change to mp4 again)
4. in terminal run the file with python Convertor.py
5. it will show you a loading bar and estimated finishing time.
6. You will get a Output video once its done.

I have attached the output file I got. Its from recent launch of Starship 5.
